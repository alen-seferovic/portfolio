      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a senior at Purdue University studying Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineering, graduating in May 2026, with a focus on aerodynamics 
        and coursework in structures. I am passionate about commercial aircraft and the critical engineering challenges involved 
        in their development, including designing structures to withstand cyclic loading and performing rigorous aerodynamic testing 
        to validate performance and efficiency.
        I also serve as an undergraduate teaching assistant for a fluid mechanics course (AAE 333), providing instructional support 
        and mentoring students in engineering fundamentals.</p>
