      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a senior at Purdue University studying Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineering, graduating in May 2026 with a specialization in aerodynamics.
        I am passionate about commercial aircraft and the critical engineering challenges involved 
        in their development, particularly within aerodynamics-related R&D.
        I also serve as an undergraduate teaching assistant providing instructional support 
        and mentoring students in engineering fundamentals. This Fall, I am a TA in AAE 333 (Fluid Mechanics), and last Spring I was a TA in AAE 204 (Mechanics of Materials).</p>
